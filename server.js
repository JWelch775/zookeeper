//Whenever we need to ask for another file's information in our HTML file, such as <script src="script.js"> 
//or <link href="style.css">, we're actually making HTTP GET requests for a file's data. 
//Yes, all of that code lives within our folder structure, but even local requests occur over HTTP.
//
//So as far as our problem goes, our HTML file loads and immediately makes requests to 
//http://localhost:3001/assets/js/script.js and http://localhost:3001/assets/css/style.css. 
//The problem here is that we never created explicit routes in our Express.js server 
//to look for and serve those files when requested. 
//Remember, any time we make a request to the server, it looks at every single route we've explicitly created. 
//If it doesn't find a matching route name, it will think that there's something wrong 
//and won't provide a response.
//
//We need to fix this in our server so it knows that when we ask for front-end resources such as 
//images, client-side JavaScript code, or CSS code, the server knows how to respond. 
//Here's the thing, thoughâ€”do we have to actually create a route for every front-end asset that we could ever 
//possibly have to use? What happens if we have 10 pages with their own CSS, JavaScript, and images? 
//That's a lot of routes!
//
//Luckily, we don't have to do that. Instead, we can set up some more Express.js middleware that instructs 
//the server to make certain files readily available and to not gate it behind a server endpoint.
//
//Add the following code to the top of the server.js file, near the two app.use() methods:

//We added some more middleware to our server and used the express.static() method. 
//The way it works is that we provide a file path to a location in our application 
//(in this case, the public folder) and instruct the server to make these files static resources. 
//This means that all of our front-end code can now be accessed without having a specific server endpoint 
//created for it!
app.use(express.static('public'));

//parse incoming string or array data
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));

//parse incoming JSON data

//GET path for the HTML

//So far we've only used routes that have actual names like /api/animals, 
//so where do you think the / route points us to? It brings us to the root route of the server! 
//This is the route used to create a homepage for a server.
//
//Unlike most GET and POST routes that deal with creating or return JSON data, this GET route 
//has just one job to do, and that is to respond with an HTML page to display in the browser. 
//So instead of using res.json(), we're using res.sendFile(), and all we have to do is tell them 
//where to find the file we want our server to read and send back to the client.
//
//Notice in the res.sendFile() that we're using the path module again to ensure that we're 
//finding the correct location for the HTML code we want to display in the browser. 
//This way, we know it will work in any server environment!

//Before Express.js and its res.sendFile() method, the process for serving an HTML page was a 
//little more manual. It involved using the fs module to locate and read the file's content, 
//then send it back to the client using the simpler res.send() method.
//
//When we use res.sendFile(), all of that functionality is built into the method. All we need to do is 
//tell them where exactly our file is located and the method will do the rest!
